## Feasibility Layer Aided ML for SCUC
This set of codes implements our TPWRS paper "Feasibility Layer Aided Machine Learning Approach for Day-Ahead Operations".

## Test Power Systems
There are five test power systems used in this work:
1. IEEE 24-bus system: one area of the IEEE 73-bus system.
2. IEEE 73-bus system: the original data of this test system are described in this reference: "The IEEE Reliability Test System-1996. A report prepared by the Reliability Test System Task Force of the Application of Probability Methods Subcommittee" and link is <a class="" target="_blank" href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/780914">here</a>.
3. IEEE 118-bus system: the original data of this test case are from the link below (in IEEE Common Data Format (ieee118cdf.txt)): https://labs.ece.uw.edu/pstca/pf118/ieee118cdf.txt
4. South-Carolina (SC) synthetic 500-bus system: the original data of this test system are from https://electricgrids.engr.tamu.edu/electric-grid-test-cases/activsg500/
5. The 2383-bus Polish system: the original data of this test system are from matpower (https://matpower.org/). The data were provided by Roman Korab (roman.korab@polsl.pl).
